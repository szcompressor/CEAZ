# Compression application using adaptive Huffman coding
# 
# Usage: python adaptive-huffman-compress.py InputFile OutputFile
# Then use the corresponding adaptive-huffman-decompress.py application to recreate the original input file.
# Note that the application starts with a flat frequency table of 257 symbols (all set to a frequency of 1),
# collects statistics while bytes are being encoded, and regenerates the Huffman code periodically. The
# corresponding decompressor program also starts with a flat frequency table, updates it while bytes are being
# decoded, and regenerates the Huffman code periodically at the exact same points in time. It is by design that
# the compressor and decompressor have synchronized states, so that the data can be decompressed properly.
